# Doorsteps Code Test

## Setup

* Install Node 8.9.2
* Clone repo, cd into directory
* Run `yarn` to setup Node modules

## Run

`yarn start`

## Phase 1: React/Redux

### What you need to do (Chris, you've done all this)

1. ~~Fork this repository to your GitHub account.~~
2. ~~Check out `src/state/actions.js` and add code to fulfill the commented instructions.~~
3. ~~Check out `src/SongsList.js` and fulfill commented "TODO" instructions.~~
4. ~~Add any styling that you deem necessary to `src/index.css`.~~
5. ~~Submit an upstream pull request with your work.~~

## Phase 2: All about Node

### What you need to do

**Implement Node.js API in `src/api/server.js` and `src/api/songs.js` files.**
1. Use _ONLY_ built-in Node modules (http, fs, zlib, etc).
2. Feel free to use all es2015+ syntax (whatever Node 8.9.2 supports).
3. See ^ above files for futher implementation notes.
4. Put a button in the frontend UI to trigger server song file refresh.
5. Submit an upstream pull request with your work.
